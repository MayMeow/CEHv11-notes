# Macvlan networking
Network connection between Docker container interfaces and parent host interface.

---
# Overlay networking
Creates a distributed network among multiple Docker daemon hosts.

---
# Host networking
The container's network stack is not isolated from the Docker host, the container shares the host's networking namespace and the container does not get its own IP-address allocated.

---
# Bridge networking
Uses a software bridge which allows containers connected to the same bridge network to communicate, while providing isolation from containers which are not connected to that bridge network.

---
# Static application security testing (SAST)
Used to secure software by reviewing the source code of the software to identify vulnerabilities.

---
# Dynamic application security testing (DAST)
Used to identify vulnerabilities in web applications through front-end.

---
# Mobile application security testing (MAST)
Blend of SAST and DAST. Tests mobile applications for mobile-specific issues such as jailbreaking, rooting, spoofed Wi-Fi connections etc.

---
# Interactive application security testing (IAST)
Blend of SAST and DAST. Checks whether a known vulnerability can be exploited in a running application.

---
# DNSSEC
A suite of Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) specifications for securing certain kinds of information provided by DNS for use on IP networks.

---
# SOAP
Exchanges data between web services. Allows for any programming model. Using Extensible Markup Language. Compatible with application level protocols like SMTP, FTP, HTTP, HTTPS etc. 
Has three major characteristics:
- extensibility
- neutrality
- independence

---
# Heartbleed bug
OpenSSL vulnerability in the cryptography library.

---
# Shellshock
A family of security bugs in the bash shell. Could enable an attacker to cause bash to execute arbitrary commands and gain unauthorized access to servers.

---
# Poodle
MiTM exploit which takes advantage of Internet and security software clients' fallback to SSL 3.0.

---
# Fuzz testing
Automated software testing technique that involves providing invalid, random data as inputs to a computer.

---
# Concolic testing
Hybrid software verification technique that performs symbolic execution.

---
# ZigBee
Short range (10-100m) communication protocol.

---
# Dragonblood
WPA3 vulnerability.

---
# Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
A structure designed to verify and authenticate the identity of individuals within the enterprise taking part in a data exchange.

---
# Yagi antenna
10 MHz to VHF UHF

---
# Unspecified proxy activities
The attacker created and configured multiple domains pointing to the same host to switch quickly between the domains and avoid detection.
