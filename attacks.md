# SQLi
Code injection technique, used to attack data-driven applications in which malicious SQL statements are inserted into an entry field for execution.

## Blind SQLi
Attacker sends payloads to the server and observes the response and behavior of the server to learn more about its structure. Attacker cannot see information about the attack in-band.
#### Boolean blind SQLi
The result will vary depending on whether the query is true or false.

UNION keyword can be used to retrieve data from other tables within the database.

## Out-of-band SQLi
Used when the attacker cannot use the same channel to launch the attack and gather information , or when a server is too slow or unstable for these actions. These techniques count on the capacity of the server to create DNS or HTTP requests to transfer data to an attacker.
