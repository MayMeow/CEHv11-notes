## Assessment types

##### Passive assessment
Traffic sniffing on the network to identify the active systems, network services, applications and vulnerabilities.

##### Active assessment
A type of vulnerability assessment that uses network scanners to identify the hosts, services and vulnerabilities present in a network.

##### External assessment
Examines the network from a hacker's point of view to identify exploits and vulnerabilities accessible to the outside world. These use firewalls, routers and servers.

##### Internal assessment
Involves scrutinizing the internal network to find exploits and vulnerabilities.
