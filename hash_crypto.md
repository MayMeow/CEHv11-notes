# SHA-1
Produces a 160 bit digest from a message on principles similar to those used in MD4 and MD5.

---
# SHA-2
Consists of six hash functions with hash values that are 224, 256, 384 or 512 bits.

---
# RSA
Based on factoring the product of two large prime numbers. Uses private keys.

---
# MD5
Hash function producing a 128 bit hash value.

---
# RC5
Simple symmetric key block cipher.

---
# Twofish
Symmetric key block cipher with 128 bit block size, and key size up to 256 bits.

---
# Triple DES
Uses 64 bit clock size encrypted three times.

---
# AES
Symmetric, fixed block size of 128 bits and a key size of 128, 192, 256 bits.

---
# DES
Symmetric key encryption algorithm with 64 bits of block size and 56 bits of key size.

---
# CAST-128
12 or 16 round Feistel network with a 64 bit block size and a key size between 40 and 128 bits.

---
# Serpent
Symmetric key block cipher, 128 bits blocks representing 32 round SP-network operating on a block of four 32 bit words.
